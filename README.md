This program is a PDF to Word Cloud generator. It allows users to upload a PDF file and generates a word cloud based on the text content of the PDF. The program uses the PyPDF2 library to extract text from the PDF and the wordcloud library to generate the word cloud.

The program offers several customization options to the user. They can choose the color theme of the word cloud, whether to display the most used or least used words, and the size of the word cloud. Users can also upload a custom font for the word cloud.

The program displays the word cloud and a table with details of the words used in the PDF. The table includes the word, its frequency, and a serial number. The words in the table can be sorted by frequency in ascending or descending order.

Users can download the word cloud as a JPEG, PNG, or SVG file. The program provides clear error messages if there are any issues with the uploaded PDF or the generation of the word cloud.

The program includes a sidebar with links to the developer's LinkedIn profile. The main menu of Streamlit is hidden for a cleaner user interface.
